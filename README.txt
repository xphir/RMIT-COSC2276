Analytical justification of the advantages offered by a social media login instead of the local login:
	- Improves security (no longer have to store customer passwords and information)
	- Improves compliance (SSO providers generaly handle passwords ect to a higher compliance level suitable for regulations ect.)
	- Reduces user management overhead (no longer have to setup and create users, no longer have to reset user passwords ect.)
	- Improves customer satisfaction (customers dont have to remember a seperate password for your website)
	- Allows easier interation with other business/software platforms that also support SSO
	
Analytical justification of the advantages offered using Angular and WebAPI:
	- Easier to scale, much easier platform to build with a scaleable dataset and backend
	- Allow interaction with multiple different datasources (eg multiple APIs)
	- Easier bug finding vs traditional javascript
	- Eaiser to maintain as components can be easily seperated/detached/added without impact to other parts
	- Reusability/Readability due to encapsulation
